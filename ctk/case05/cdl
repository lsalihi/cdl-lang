# CTK Case05: Parameterized Types

This test case validates parameterized types like Money(currency) and other generic type constructs.

## CDL Specification

```cdl
type Money
  amount: decimal where amount >= 0
  currency: string
end

type Product
  id: string
  name: string
  price: Money
  category: string
end

type Invoice
  id: string
  customerId: string
  items: Product
  totalEUR: Money
  totalUSD: Money
  issueDate: date
  dueDate: date where dueDate >= issueDate
end

intent CREATE_INVOICE
  goal: "Create a new invoice with multi-currency support"
  inputs: "[invoice: Invoice]"
  outputs: "[invoiceId: string, pdfUrl: string]"
  evidence: "[invoice_generation_spec]"
  tags: "[billing, finance, multicurrency]"
end

mapping CREATE_INVOICE -> "api POST /api/invoices"
  request: "InvoiceRequest"
  response: "InvoiceResponse"
end
```

## Expected Validation
- ✅ Parameterized types are properly handled
- ✅ Money type generates correct OpenAPI schema
- ✅ Multiple instances of same base type work correctly
- ✅ Constraints are properly applied to parameterized types
