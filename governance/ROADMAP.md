## Contributing to the Roadmap

The roadmap is community-driven. To propose changes:

1. Open a GitHub Discussion with your idea
2. Create a CEP (CDL Enhancement Proposal) for major features
3. Join roadmap planning sessions (announced on GitHub)

## Release Cadence

- **Patch releases**: As needed for bug fixes
- **Minor releases**: Every 6-8 weeks with new features
- **Major releases**: Annually with breaking changes

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: Number of public repositories using CDL
- **Ecosystem**: Third-party tools and integrations
- **Community**: Active contributors and users
- **Standards**: Industry recognition and standards adoption
