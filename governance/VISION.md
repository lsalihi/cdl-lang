# CDL Vision

## The Cognitive Domain Language

**CDL is a universal declarative language for expressing, structuring, and executing business logic and cognitive knowledge across all domains and technologies.**

## Core Philosophy

In an increasingly complex world of distributed systems, AI, and regulatory requirements, organizations struggle to maintain consistency between:

- **Business Intent**: What the system should do
- **Technical Implementation**: How it's built
- **Documentation**: How it's explained
- **Compliance**: What rules it must follow
- **Testing**: How correctness is verified

CDL bridges this gap by providing a **single source of truth** that can be understood by business stakeholders, developers, auditors, and machines.

## The Problem CDL Solves

### Current State
- Business logic scattered across code, docs, and databases
- Inconsistencies between specification and implementation
- Manual translation between business requirements and technical artifacts
- Lack of executable documentation
- Regulatory compliance buried in code comments

### CDL Solution
- **Declarative**: Express business logic in natural, readable terms
- **Executable**: Generate APIs, policies, tests from single source
- **Universal**: Works across domains (finance, healthcare, AI, etc.)
- **Evolvable**: Type-safe, versioned, backward-compatible
- **Governed**: Open standard with community oversight

## Vision Statement

**To become the universal language for cognitive domain modeling, enabling organizations to express their business logic once and execute it everywhere.**

## Key Principles

### 1. Cognitive Clarity
CDL prioritizes human understanding over machine optimization. Code should read like documentation.

### 2. Universal Applicability
No assumptions about technology stack, industry, or use case. CDL works for APIs, policies, AI models, and business processes.

### 3. Executable Specifications
CDL files are both human-readable documentation and machine-executable code.

### 4. Strong Governance
Open standard with clear evolution process, ensuring long-term stability and interoperability.

### 5. Ecosystem First
CDL succeeds through a rich ecosystem of tools, integrations, and community contributions.

## Target Audience

### Business Stakeholders
- Product managers defining requirements
- Compliance officers documenting regulations
- Auditors verifying system behavior
- Domain experts capturing business rules

### Technical Teams
- Architects designing systems
- Developers implementing features
- DevOps engineers deploying infrastructure
- QA engineers creating test suites

### Organizations
- Financial institutions managing regulatory compliance
- Healthcare providers ensuring data privacy
- AI companies governing model behavior
- Government agencies automating policy execution

## Long-term Impact

### Industry Transformation
- **Standardization**: Common language for business logic across industries
- **Interoperability**: Systems can understand each other's business rules
- **Compliance**: Automated verification of regulatory requirements
- **Innovation**: Faster development of cognitive systems

### Technical Evolution
- **AI Integration**: Natural language for AI system specifications
- **Policy as Code**: Governance and security as first-class concepts
- **Executable Documentation**: Living specifications that stay current
- **Cross-system Consistency**: Unified business logic across microservices

## Success Metrics

### Adoption Metrics
- **Market Penetration**: Percentage of enterprise systems using CDL
- **Ecosystem Size**: Number of third-party tools and integrations
- **Community Growth**: Active contributors and user organizations

### Technical Metrics
- **Language Stability**: Backward compatibility across major versions
- **Performance**: Compilation and generation speeds
- **Expressiveness**: Ability to model complex business domains

### Business Metrics
- **Time to Market**: Reduction in development cycles
- **Compliance Efficiency**: Automated regulatory verification
- **System Reliability**: Reduction in business logic errors

## Relationship to Other Standards

### Complementary Standards
- **OpenAPI**: CDL generates OpenAPI specs, doesn't replace them
- **JSON Schema**: Used for type definitions within CDL
- **Rego**: Target for policy generation
- **SQL**: Complements but doesn't replace data querying

### Positioning
CDL sits at the **business logic layer**, above technical implementation details but below natural language requirements. It serves as the bridge between human intent and machine execution.

## Governance and Evolution

### Open Standard
- **Public Specification**: Freely available, Apache 2.0 licensed
- **Community Driven**: RFC process for changes
- **Vendor Neutral**: No single company controls the standard

### Version Strategy
- **Semantic Versioning**: Breaking.Major.Minor
- **Long-term Support**: 2-year LTS for major versions
- **Deprecation Policy**: Clear migration paths

### Ecosystem Development
- **Reference Implementations**: Official parsers and generators
- **Third-party Tools**: IDE plugins, converters, validators
- **Training and Certification**: For implementers and users

## Call to Action

CDL represents a fundamental shift in how we think about software systems - from code-centric to cognition-centric development.

**Join us in building the future of declarative business logic.**
